# ShrinkNote
ShrinkNote is a simple program used to condense and clarify handwritten
notes.  The program optimizes pages of notes for computer displays by
grabbing a set of a few representative colors, and then building the
remaining image with that palette.
## FAQ's
- yes it does run that slow, the program hasn't crashed, tkinter just
shows as not responding.  (If anyone wants to fix this, version 2.0 needs
to include multi-threading.
- no i don't know why it isn't running, if you have any bugs or crashes send them to me.
## Requirements
- Python 3.7.x or newer, and the following packages
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - Pillow (PIL)

the easiest way to install these is to run the following:

```python
-pip install numpy scipy Pillow
```

## Installation
Download the projects as a .zip, then run main.py.  For debugging purposes, run backend.py.
